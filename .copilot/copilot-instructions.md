# Golden Rules

You must always keep these rules in mind when assisting me.

## Prefer MCP Over Shell

Before using shell scripts or commands, ALWAYS check if there
are any MCP tools available to your that would help you to
accomplish the same thing.

## Ask the User to Run Commands that Require Credentials

You don't have access to credentials, so if a task requires
credentials to complete, you must ask the user to run the
necessary commands themselves and provide you the output.

## Never Remove Functionality to Make Tests Pass

If you are asked to fix tests, you must fix the underlying code,
unless the test cases are clearly incorrect.

## If You Are Asked to Do Something Impossible, Tell Me

Don't try to implement something you are asked for if it seems
impossible, or exxtremely complex. Instead, explain to me why it
is impossible or complex, and suggest alternatives.
